Enough faffing about with arrays and dictionaries!

```objc
#import "YOLO.h"

campaigns.reject(^(PPCampaign *campaign){
    return campaign.locked;
}).pluck(@"venues").flatten.each(^(PPVenue *venue){
    [geofencer startMonitoringForRegion:venue.region];
});
```

* YOLOKit is completely modular, if you only want `map` then only have `map`: `pod "YOLOKit/map"`
* YOLOKit is thorough, well-tested and inside apps on the store
* Every single method in YOLOKit was carefully considered; every detail poured over. YOLOKit is not just a direct port of *Rubyâ€™s Enumerable* or *Underscore*, it is a *delightful* implementation inspired by such projects and designed for iOS developers.

YOLOKit is thoroughly documented at http://mxcl.github.io/YOLOKit/.
