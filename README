Suggested usage:

*   git submodule init
    git submodule add https://github.com/mxcl/MBCategories

* Add the single file MBCategories.m to your project.
* #import "MBCategories.h" in your precompiled header.

This way you don't have to add or remove files to your project when keeping
MBCategories up-to-date.

If anyone knows a good way to drop an XcodeProj file as a sub-project into an
Xcode 4 iOS project so that it builds all the sources and all just works,
please let me know.
